Hey all, season 2 of the Dreary Middle podcast starts on Monday! But before then, do I have an exciting announcement for you all: Dreary Middle COLON The Podcast is now ENHANCED!

But what exactly does that mean I hear you ask? Well, it means that you will now start seeing images and a chapter list alongside the audio of our podcasts:
<div style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><img border="0" data-original-height="2436" data-original-width="1125" height="320" src="/assets/images/posts/enhanced1.PNG" /><img border="0" data-original-height="2436" data-original-width="1125" height="320" src="/assets/images/posts/enhanced2.PNG" style="text-align: start;" width="148" /></div>

Man, is this ever exciting! Not to be confused with the old Apple way of doing it by using their proprietary .m4a standard and Garage Band podcast editing features, this is using a bog standard .mp3 file and using and often overlooked feature of the [ID3v2 metadata](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ID3#ID3v2_chapters), as such, no special hardware or software is required. Any device can play the file, but only apps with the capability to read the data can show the pictures and chapters.

## FAQ
Q. Does this affect file size?
: A. Yes, each image increases the file size by the size of the image. For the best results across all devices we use the dimensions and quality of the image file meaning that a long podcast can see an increase of about 10 MB to accommodate the new images

Q. Do I need to be on iOS?
: A. No, since this is a, quote on quote, open standard (when compared to m4a), anybody is free to bake this in to their apps, please reach out to the developer of your favourite podcast app if your podcast app does not currently support MP3 chapters

Q. Will the Dreary Middle website support enhanced podcasts?
: A. We sure hope so, but as of right now we are relying on your web browser to do all the legwork for us with regards to audio playback capability, we chose this route initially as it required less work on our end for something to just "work". Mobile, desktop, games console, you name it, we didn't have to worry about it, your device would handle it for us. This means greater compatibility and lower battery drain. So for now it's up to your browser to supports enhanced podcasts until we find a solution that works!

Q. Can I see a video of this in action?
: A. Sure, here it is running on Apple Podcasts on iOS 13.6.1

Q. Do you have a file I can test this with?
: A. Yes, in fact, this trailer here has chapters, hidden chapters, images and links. Feel free to download the file and try it in any media player/podcast app to see if it works in your current setup:
