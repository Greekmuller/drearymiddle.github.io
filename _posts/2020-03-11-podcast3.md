Welcome back to the second part of our retrospective series on the Danganronpa series. This time we're taking a look at Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair. A fan favourite as well jrmswell's high point of the series.

As before we're going to take a look at the six chapters that defined not just Hajime and the gang's future in the series but also the tone of the series as a whole. This one's a long one so sit down, relax and of course enjoy this two hour extravaganza as we present an unrelenting amount of praise for: Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair
