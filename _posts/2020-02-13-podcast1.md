Hello and welcome to the first episode of Dreary Middle COLON The Podcast. A new show where all your hosts do is talk about the things they like, and to immediately buck that trend they're talking about something they don't like; Star Trek: Picard.

In this first episode we will talk about how the first three episodes feel almost anti Star Trek: The Next Generation in execution, later on we'll take a quick retrospective look on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine as Hysteria103 watches the show for the first time!

Don't forget to let us know your thoughts on this first episode in the comments or reviews!
