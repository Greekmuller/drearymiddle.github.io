Hello and welcome to the second episode of our podcast and the start of a mini series looking back at the Danganronpa series. A series that we're both quite fond of.

In the first part we're looking at the first game in the series: Trigger Happy Havoc: Danganronpa, we'll take you through all six chapters, give you our thoughts and feelings, and of course talk for way too long on this subject.

Stay tuned for the second part coming in the near future!

Edit: The game also went on sale, get it while it's hot!
